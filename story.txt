There was once a cute cat named Stan. His best friend was a snake plant named Remy, who is in the same house. One day, Stan's owners seemed
to become very stressed. Stan could not figure out why they were so worried and focusing on their computers. Unfortunately, Stan's owners
are college students who had to prepare for their first round of midterms. Stan went to Remy because he was very concerned for them, and
together, Remy and Stan hitched a plan to destress their owners.


Nicole: Stan and Remy decided to go to the store and find the funniest outfits they could. Due to it being close to halloween, all the clothes they could find were costumes! Stan decided to be a witch and Remy decided to be a pumpkin. Stand and Remy were very excited to bring home their new costumes to make their owners smile and laugh. When Stand and Remy were almost home from the store, they dropped their costumes intoa puddle and they were ruined! Now Stan and Remy needed a new plan to make their owners destress. At home, they thought of the perfect plan.

Liza: Stan and Remy carried the costumes home and hung them out to dry. They then changed plans and decided to put on a show for their owners. They quickly put together a dancing routing and headed out to see their owners. As a study break, they danced around on their hind legs and jumped up and down, putting on the most spectacular show. Their owners were so pleased and happy that they were able to return to their studying with ease and happiness! Then they passed all their midterms with flying colors.
