There was once a cute cat named Stan. His best friend was a snake plant named Remy, who is in the same house. One day, Stan's owners seemed
to become very stressed. Stan could not figure out why they were so worried and focusing on their computers. Unfortunately, Stan's owners
are college students who had to prepare for their first round of midterms. Stan went to Remy because he was very concerned for them, and
together, Remy and Stan hitched a plan to destress their owners.
