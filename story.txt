There was once a cute cat named Stan. His best friend was a snake plant named Remy, who is in the same house. One day, Stan's owners seemed
to become very stressed. Stan could not figure out why they were so worried and focusing on their computers. Unfortunately, Stan's owners
are college students who had to prepare for their first round of midterms. Stan went to Remy because he was very concerned for them, and
together, Remy and Stan hitched a plan to destress their owners.


Nicole: Stan and Remy decided to go to the store and find the funniest outfits they could. Due to it being close to halloween, all the clothes they could find were costumes! Stan decided to be a witch and Remy decided to be a pumpkin. Stand and Remy were very excited to bring home their new costumes to make their owners smile and laugh. When Stand and Remy were almost home from the store, they dropped their costumes intoa puddle and they were ruined! Now Stan and Remy needed a new plan to make their owners destress. At home, they thought of the perfect plan.
